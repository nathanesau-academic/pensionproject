You are the new actuary of a small pension plan. You won the client from another
actuarial firm and now are performing the valuation as at December 31, 2013. The
previous valuation was performed as at December 31, 2012.

## Task

Create a spreadsheet to perform all the calcuations to determine:

### 2012

* The actuarial liability on going-concern basis at December 31, 2012
* The fudning position on going-concern basis at December 31, 2012
* The normal cost for 2013
* The actuarial liability on solvency basis at December 13, 2012
* The funding position on solvency basis at December 31, 2012
* The minimum contribution requirements for 2013

### 2013

* The actuarial liabilitiy on going-concern basis at December 31, 2013
* The funding position on going-concern basis at Decemer 31, 2013
* The normal cost for 2014
* Reconciliation of going-concern funding position at December 31, 2013 with
  going-concern funding position at December 31, 2013, identifying gain and loss
  elements by source
* The actuarial liability on solvency basis at December 31, 2013
* The funding position on solvency basis at December 13, 2013
* The minimum contribution requirements for 2014

Prepare a written actuarial report summariziing the results, data, methods and
assumptions. Make a presentation of your results, with an emphasis on the
reasons for the changes in the going-concern funding position and the impact on
each of the changes in actuarial assumptions.
